•	Detecting fake news can be a tiring task but is indeed a very important one to maintain the integrity of information. This project aims to build a model to distinguish between real and fake news. 
•	We started by loading two datasets containing false news articles and true news articles while labelling them as 0 and 1 respectively. We combined these datasets into one data frame and used train test split to train the model via logistic regression. We evaluated the accuracy of our model (mine is 98.9% accurate) while also getting confusion matrix and coefficients of the logistic regression to support the working of model.
