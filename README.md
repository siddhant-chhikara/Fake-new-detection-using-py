•	Detecting fake news can be a tiring task but is indeed a very important one to maintain the integrity of information. This project aims to build a model to distinguish between real and fake news. 

•	We started by loading two datasets containing false news articles and true news articles while labelling them as 0 and 1 respectively. We combined these datasets into one data frame and used train test split to train the model via logistic regression. We evaluated the accuracy of our model (mine is 98.9% accurate) while also getting confusion matrix and coefficients of the logistic regression to support the working of model.

•	The model worked pretty accurately and was about to distinguish 98.9% of the news correctly.

•	Accuracy = 98.9%

•	Confusion Matrix = True Positives – 2238 , True Negatives – 2203 ,  False Positives – 26 ,           False Negatives - 23
